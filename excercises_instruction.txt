we want to create a new tab on the same level as Node Information  that would be a 
Lexical exercise - a way to learn about the word by actively engaging in conversation

there has to be diffenret levels of learing 
1 - begginer 1
2 - begginer 2
3 - intermediate 1
4 - intermediate 2
5 - advanced 1
6 - advanced 2

This can be chosen as a dropdown

i am thinking to have a kind of chatbot implementation , with chat memory for the session

the conversation should initially begin with introducing the word in common theme, topic
using the words from the instantiated graph, and with common constructions, appropriate for the level of learning

in the begginer levels there should be transliteration and english transliteration
