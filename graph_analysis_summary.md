# Japanese Lexical Graph Analysis Summary

## Overview of G_synonyms_2024_09_18.pickle

This document presents a summary of the structural analysis performed on the Japanese lexical graph contained in `G_synonyms_2024_09_18.pickle`. The analysis reveals important information about the structure, connectivity, and characteristics of this language network.

## Key Findings

### Basic Statistics

- **Graph Size**: 60,751 nodes (words/concepts) and 127,960 edges (synonym relationships)
- **Graph Type**: Undirected - relationships between words are bidirectional
- **Graph Density**: 0.00006934 (very sparse) - indicates that only a tiny fraction of possible connections exist
- **Data Quality**: 1 NaN node was found and removed from the analysis

### Connectivity

- **Connected Components**: 51 separate components (subgraphs)
- **Main Component**: 98.79% of all nodes (60,015 nodes) are in the largest connected component
- **Isolation**: The remaining 1.21% of nodes are in small isolated components

### Node Attributes

The nodes in the graph contain rich linguistic metadata:
- `hiragana`: Hiragana reading of the word
- `POS`: Part of speech
- `translation`: English translation
- `JLPT`: Japanese Language Proficiency Test level
- `jlpt_jisho_lemma`: Related to dictionary lookup

### Degree Distribution

- **Average Degree**: 4.21 connections per word
- **Maximum Degree**: 79 connections (for the word "計画" meaning "plan")
- **Distribution Shape**: 
  - The degree distribution follows a power-law-like pattern
  - 65.2% of nodes (39,611) have only 1 connection, indicating many words with unique meanings
  - Only a small percentage of nodes have high degrees (hubs)

### Centrality Analysis

From a sample of 1000 nodes:
- Words with highest degree centrality: 白寿 (longevity), 時計 (clock/watch), 変質 (change/transformation), 無垢 (purity/innocence), 感度 (sensitivity)
- Betweenness centrality values were very low, suggesting minimal "bridge words" in the sample

### Community Structure

- **Modularity**: 0.9740 (very high) - indicates well-defined communities
- **Communities**: 962 communities detected in a 1000-node sample
- **Community Size**: Most communities are very small (2-4 nodes)

## Implications

1. **Network Structure**: The Japanese lexical network exhibits properties of a scale-free network with many specialized words (low degree) and few hub words (high degree)

2. **Semantic Organization**: The high modularity and many small communities suggest Japanese vocabulary is organized into tight semantic clusters with clear boundaries

3. **Core Vocabulary**: The highest-degree nodes (like "計画") likely represent core concepts with many synonyms or related terms

4. **Semantic Navigation**: The high connectivity of the main component (98.79%) suggests most Japanese concepts can be reached from other concepts through synonym relationships

## Applications

This graph structure analysis can be valuable for:

- Japanese language learning applications (vocabulary building)
- Natural language processing for Japanese text
- Semantic analysis and understanding
- Machine translation improvement
- Linguistic research on Japanese lexical organization

## Next Steps

Further analysis could include:
- Temporal evolution of the lexical network
- Correlation between JLPT levels and network position
- Comparison with lexical networks of other languages
- Semantic categorization of communities
- Path analysis between different concept domains
